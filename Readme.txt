This project is an exploration with the intent to observe interesting emergent behavior from a simulation of chemical reactions, loosely based on the Gray-Scott model of reaction and diffusion.

Motivation as laid out here: https://technologyphilosophy.wordpress.com/2016/12/17/my-quest-for-cells-inside-a-computer/

My original thoughts on a “pre-RNA word”: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwAalOLGnTC9WEgtaENoXzFGSHc

This project includes two classes, “reactions” (the main class) and “Grid”.
